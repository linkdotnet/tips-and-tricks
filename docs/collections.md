# Collections
This chapter looks closer to collections and its best practices.

## Passing collections as a method parameter 

If your method needs to accept a collection as a parameter, then generally `IEnumerable<T>` is the best choice. This offers the most flexibility to the caller. It doesn't matter what concrete collection type they use, and it even allows them to pass lazily evaluated sequences in.

❌ **Bad** We have to call `ToList` before passing argument.
```csharp
void ApplyFilter<T>(this List<T> items, Expression<Func<T, bool>> source)
{
    // ...
}

void Caller() 
{
    var products = dbContext.Products;
    products = products.ToList().ApplyFilterByTitle(p => p.Title = "IPhone"); // requires us to add a ToList instead of lazily evaluated IEnumerable
}
```

✅ **Good** Allows the caller to pass in a `lazily evaluated IEnumerable` generated by the LINQ Where.
```csharp
void ApplyFilter<T>(this IEnumerable<T> items, Expression<Func<T, bool>> source)
{
    // ...
}

void Caller() 
{
    var products = dbContext.Products;
    products = products.ApplyFilterByTitle(p => p.Title = "IPhone"); // works fine without calling ToList directly
}
```
